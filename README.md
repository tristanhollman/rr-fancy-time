# rr-fancy-time

A small and fun project for a time-themed hackathon at [R&R WFM](https://github.com/rr-wfm). Using React and ThreeJS to create a cool visualization of the current time.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Inspirations

### Petal Shaders
I was inspired by one of [Paul's](https://codepen.io/prisoner849) CodePen projects and based some of the GLSL shader code on his petal implementation :)
